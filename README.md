# Zero, a little Gopher client

Zero, named after the character from Holes who is great at digging holes (like a gopher is), is a cross-platform and very minimal Gopher client. It abides by RFC 1436 and also works with some non-standard but widely adopted conventions like info lines in directories.

## Build

Run ```make``` or ```make debug```. I've tested on Windows and Linux.

## Run

Run in any CLI! Browse the Gopher-verse (I recommend gopher.floodgap.com and sdf.org as starting points). Report any issues you face on this Github repo.
